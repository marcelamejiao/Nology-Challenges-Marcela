# REACT CHALLENGE

## useState

* Create a card component which has a button to generate a random time (hours is fine don't worry about minutes for now)
* Based on the time, either render the sun(6-18) or the moon icon (between 0-6 or 18-24)
* Also add background and text colour to reflect light or dark mode based on the sun or moon
